### 🏛️ Professional Summary
**Engineering-driven Analyst transitioning to Energy Investment Banking.**
I leverage a background in **Chemical Process Engineering** (Thermodynamics, Mass Balance) to build rigorous financial intelligence platforms for the energy sector. My work focuses on quantifying the "Physical Reality" of assets—rejecting standard accounting assumptions in favor of engineered precision (e.g., modeling reservoir decline curves vs. perpetual growth).

Currently President of the **Student-Athlete Advisory Council** at Notre Dame, representing 700+ D1 athletes while completing an MSBA.

### 🚀 Flagship Intelligence Platforms

#### 1. [Energy Capital Discipline Monitor (Live Risk Engine)](https://github.com/eganl2024-sudo/Energy-Capital-Discipline-Monitor)
*A real-time fintech platform tracking shareholder yield, solvency, and capital allocation across the Oil & Gas Super-Majors.*

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://energy-capital-monitor.streamlit.app)

* **The Thesis:** The market has shifted from "Volume" to "Value." Investors no longer reward growth; they reward **Cash Flow Durability**.
* **The Solution:** Engineered a live diagnostic engine that normalizes global accounting data (US GAAP vs. IFRS) to calculate **Dividend Sustainability Ratios (DSR)** and **Cash Breakevens** in real-time.
* **Key Alpha:** Built an interactive "Oil Price Shock" simulator (0-50% OCF downturn). **Finding:** Shell (SHEL) currently displays higher solvency resilience than Chevron (CVX) under a 40% crash scenario, challenging historical sector norms.
* **Stack:** Python, Streamlit (Bloomberg UI), `yfinance` Data Ingress, LRU Caching, Arps-style Breakeven Logic.

#### 2. [Energy Valuation Engine: The "Managed Decline" Model](https://github.com/eganl2024-sudo/Energy-Valuation-Analysis)
*A forward-looking valuation tool designed to stress-test Energy Majors against the energy transition.*

* **The Problem:** Standard DCF models assume perpetual +2% growth, ignoring the physical reality of reservoir depletion.
* **The Solution:** Architected a "Managed Decline" valuation logic (-1.5% terminal growth) to quantify the floor value of fossil assets.
* **Key Alpha:** Modeled **ExxonMobil (XOM)** to reveal ~13% upside at $85/bbl oil, identifying a "Cash Cow" arbitrage opportunity where the market is pricing in an overly aggressive transition.
* **Stack:** Python (Pandas), Sensitivity Analysis (Football Fields), WACC/CAPM Stratification.
