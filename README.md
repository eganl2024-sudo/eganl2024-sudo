### 🏛️ Professional Summary
**Engineering-driven Analyst transitioning to Energy Investment Banking.**
I leverage a background in **Chemical Process Engineering** (Thermodynamics, Mass Balance) to build rigorous financial valuation models for the energy sector. My work focuses on quantifying the "Physical Reality" of assets—from reservoir depletion to metabolic power demand—rejecting standard assumptions in favor of engineered precision.

Currently President of the **Student-Athlete Advisory Council** at Notre Dame, representing 700+ D1 athletes while completing an MSBA.

### 📈 Featured Investment Thesis
#### [Energy Valuation Engine: The "Managed Decline" Model](https://github.com/eganl2024-sudo/Energy-Valuation-Analysis)
*A Python-based valuation platform designed to stress-test Energy Majors against the energy transition.*

* **The Problem:** Traditional DCF models assume perpetual +2% growth, ignoring the physical reality of reservoir depletion and capital intensity.
* **The Solution:** Architected a "Managed Decline" valuation logic (-1.5% terminal growth) to quantify the floor value of fossil assets.
* **Key Findings:** Modeled **ExxonMobil (XOM)** to reveal ~13% upside at $85/bbl oil, identifying a "Cash Cow" arbitrage opportunity where the market is pricing in an overly aggressive transition.
* **Technical Stack:** Python (Pandas), Object-Oriented Financial Modeling, Sensitivity Analysis, WACC/CAPM Stratification.
