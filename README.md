### 📌 Featured Projects

#### 1. Post-COVID Recovery Analysis: Oil & Gas Sector
*Financial and operational resilience modeling of the O&G sector (2018-2022).*
* **The Business Case:** Analyzed the recovery trajectory of major upstream players following the 2020 demand shock.
* **Engineering Edge:** Leveraged background in Chemical Engineering to contextualize financial data against upstream operational realities (production constraints and refining margins).
* **Key Focus:** Sector resilience, correlation between operational downtime and pricing volatility.
* **Tech Stack:** Python (Pandas), Financial Time-Series Analysis, Excel.

#### 2. NBA Player Salary Valuation Model
*Predictive valuation model estimating player market value against salary cap constraints.*
* **The Business Case:** Developed a benchmarking tool to identify arbitrage opportunities in player contracts (undervalued vs. overvalued assets).
* **Methodology:** Utilized regression analysis and historical performance data to project "fair market value" salaries.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Regression Analysis.

#### 3. Grow Irish Performance Analytics (Full-Stack App)
*Scalable telemetry platform transforming raw GPS data into coaching strategy.*
* **The Business Case:** Automated the analysis of metabolic power demand (MDP) to optimize training load and reduce injury risk for D1 athletes.
* **Outcome:** Built a deployable Streamlit application currently used for "Coach vs. Analyst" reporting views.
* **Tech Stack:** Streamlit, Plotly, SQL.

#### 4. FIFA Player Progression (Deep Learning)
*Benchmarking neural networks against traditional regression for asset progression.*
* **Result:** Achieved 5% accuracy improvement over baseline models via architectural optimization.
* **Tech Stack:** TensorFlow/Keras, Deep Learning.
